Q: Can you tell me about the last service appointment that was scheduled?

A: Yes, the last service appointment that was scheduled was actually today. The customer called in and gave his name alongside a time he could bring his vehicle in for the service that was needed. In which i checked times, and wrote his info down on a paper and told him the time and price.

Q: How do the technicians know what they are working on a given day?

A: They usually come in everyday blind to what they would be working on and get assigned to a service throughout the day. This can and has created confusion in the past which has caused major delays. For example, one of our guys switched the service between two vehicles which costed us money and time.

Q: Do you only do call in pre booked appointments or walk-ins too?

A: We typically do any of them, if a customer walks in and wants something done, if it appears we have the extra time and mechanics Ill try and get them in that day, if not I will schedule them a day that is free. Other than that, its usually a typical phone call by appointment which sometimes can be tricky as I have found myself forgetting specific services or incorrect information, as filling out a service order over the phone can be difficult.

# Planned POST Mapping

1. The /Mechanics will add a new mechanic to the database, and uses information from the mechanics such as their mechanicID, firstname, and lastname. Once a mechanic is successfully added to the system, the response will be a 201.

2. The /serviceOrders is where serviceOrders will be added to the database. TO succesully add a service order and get a 201, some of the necessary things needed are the serviceOrderId, vin, firstname, lastname, date recieved and completed (is null), mechanicID, and service Cost.

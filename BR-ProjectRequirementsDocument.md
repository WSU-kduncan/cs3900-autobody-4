## ShopFlow Pro

### Context

ShopFlow Pro aims to track and manage service orders within the autobody shop, and organize the flow of mechanics working on vehicles. This application features a straightfoward UI, which allows users to simply create and edit service orders. Within this application, the user is also able to assign mechanics to secific vehicles and update whether they have finished the service or not.

### Use Cases

Ben is the proud owner of his autoshop "Ben's Auto Body Experts", which he has lead and managed for over 15 years. Over the years Ben grew from himself and 2 other guys to a total of 10 workers at his shop, and has been thinking of expanding to another location with a whole new crew. Ben is very successful but with all this success he has become over worked and business has started to slow down as work orders begin to pile up and his services have gotten slower. As success comes, so does the hundreds and thundreds or customers Ben has to keep track of which has overwhelemed his old way of managing. Along with workers doing services on models they arent aware of, this has caused Ben to manage and monitor more than he'd like. This has disorganized Ben's way of work and caused the whole shop to slow down and get backed up.

Ben is eager to try a new way of not only managing his service orders but his mechanics, but is doubtful that a simple application exsists, instead he believes they are too complex for his liking. Ben only needs simple needs: to manage his service orders, assign mechanics to specific services, and what speciatlys relate to each mechanic.

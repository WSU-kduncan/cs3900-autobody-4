Q: Can you tell me about your business and the personel you have around you?

A: I own a small auto shop on the outside of Dayton that see 10-20 customers a day for various types of services. We have a staff that includes 4 Mechanics including myself.

Q: Has there been any obstacles with either your mechanics or business that you feel has held you back in anyway?

A: One of our mechanics forgot which car was supposed to get an oil change and what car was supposed to get tires rotated the other day and ended up changing the oil in the car that just needed the tires rotated.

Q: Have you ever tried using an application for your day to day job to ease the flow of work and communication?

A: We have though about using an application to keep track of our service orders. Unfortunately, we have older mechanics that work for us and they are not able to use the computer very well.

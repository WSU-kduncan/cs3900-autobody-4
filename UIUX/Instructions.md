# UI / UX - Group Project Additions

## Purpose / Objectives

- Define user flows and application wireframes for group project
- Understand how defining UI / UX elements defines the direction of upcoming project development

## Description

If you have not already, join your group's GitHub repository and clone the repository to your system.  Your contributions to the components required will be tracked via commits to your group's repository.

Create `uiux-design.md` in your group project repository.  
- Note: How you as a group choose to collect all required information and place it in the document is up to the group.

Each group member will pick an aspect of the group project to focus on for user flows and wireframing.

Create user flows for the following features with respect to your group project - each team member should pick one feature.  For each user flow, include a description of what the application behavior should be based on user actions.  Each team member must submit a PDF or JPG or PNG of their assigned user flow.
- Landing / main application page
- Search
- Create
- Update
- Delete (Optional)
    - utilize if your team has more than 3 team members
- Batch (Honors)
    - utilize if your team has more than 4 team members

Based on the user flows, each team member will build a wireframe.  All wireframes should consider navigation within the application (think menus / sidebars) and good practices based on Jakob's Ten Usability Heuristics and Gestalt Principles.  A workable list of expected wireframes are below.  Each team member must submit a PDF or JPG or PNG of their assigned wireframe.
- Landing / main application page
- Search
- Create
- Update
- Delete (Optional)
    - utilize if your team has more than 3 team members
- Batch (Honors)
    - utilize if your team has more than 4 team members

If your group feels your wireframe needs additional written context to justify a misuse of a heuristic, add it to the documentation alongside the corresponding wireframe.

## Deliverable(s)

In the group project repository, `uiux-design.md` presents:

Users flows & wireframes for:
- Landing / main application page
- Search
- Create
- Update
- Delete (Optional)
    - utilize if your team has more than 3 team members
- Batch (Honors)
    - utilize if your team has more than 4 team members

Each user flow must include a description of what the application behavior should be based on user actions.

Each wireframe should show thought towards / application of Jakob's Ten Usability Heuristics and Gestalt Principles.

## Submission

Submit link to assignment repository in the Dropbox in Pilot.  Only ONE team member needs to remember to submit the link.

URL looks like: https://github.com/WSU-kduncan/cs3900-YOURGROUPNAME

## Rubric

Score: # of out TODO points

Group contribution scores are calculated by number of members who contributed over number of group members.  This will be denoted by the following formula where $c$ is members who contributed and $m$ is number of group members:

$$ c \over m $$

- Each group member uploaded a PDF or JPG or PNG of a user flow, as reflected in commit history. $c \over m$
- Each group member uploaded a PDF or JPG or PNG of a wireframe, as reflected in commit history. $c \over m$
- `uiux-design.md` presents:
    - Landing / main application page ( / 3)
        - user flow
        - user flow description of behavior
        - wireframe that reflects understanding of Jakob's Ten Usability Heuristics and Gestalt Principles

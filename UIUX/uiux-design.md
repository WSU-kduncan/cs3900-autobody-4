> The following user flow represents the flow of a user searching a service order for our shop flow pro. The user first starts by opening up the internet to type in the web page url and sign in. After, they will be met with multiple things but in this case they will be clicking the search bar. The user then types in the customers last name and hits search, this is then where they scroll to find the service order. If the service order is not there they loop back to searching again, incase there was a typo, otherwise they have successfully searched for the customer and comes to an end.

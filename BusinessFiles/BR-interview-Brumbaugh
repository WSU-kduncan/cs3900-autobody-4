Q: How do you manage your service orders currently?

A: I had tried using a software that ended up not going too well, I lost some service orders as the application was too confusing. This ultimately led to an overall bad experience which myself and my mechanics all have agreed on discontinuing the use of the software application . I have resulted back to what I had been doing which is paper and pencils with my trusty ole filing cabinet.

Q: What information about the service order do you need in order to complete the service task?

A: There are a couple things we need in our service orders to satisfy the task. The most important being the name of the customer alongside their phone number, service they want done, type of car and price. Those are the bare minimum things to satisfy the service order, however there are more things like the year, vin, and what mechanic we will be assigning dependent on their specialty.

Q: What car brands does your shop work on?

A: We started off doing only American made cars such as Chevrolet, Fords, and Rams which worked out fairly well. We have now switched to doing every brand you bring in, but since moving to an every brand auto shop that's when we started having issues with mechanics and what they can and cant working on, brand wise.
